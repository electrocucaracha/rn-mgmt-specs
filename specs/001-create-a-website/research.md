# Research: Rental Property Management Platform

## Technology Research Decisions

### Backend Framework: Go Fiber
**Decision**: Use Go Fiber web framework for REST API
**Rationale**: 
- Express-like syntax familiar to developers
- High performance with low memory footprint
- Built-in middleware for auth, logging, CORS
- Strong ecosystem and documentation
- Minimal learning curve compared to Gin or Echo

**Alternatives considered**: 
- Gin: More popular but less Express-like syntax
- Echo: Good performance but smaller community
- Standard net/http: Too low-level for rapid development

### Database ORM: GORM
**Decision**: Use GORM v2 for PostgreSQL interactions
**Rationale**:
- Most mature Go ORM with excellent PostgreSQL support
- Auto-migration capabilities for development
- Strong association handling for related data
- Built-in validations and hooks
- Large community and extensive documentation

**Alternatives considered**:
- SQLx: Raw SQL approach, more control but higher complexity
- Ent: Facebook's ORM, powerful but steeper learning curve
- Raw SQL: Maximum control but too much boilerplate

### Frontend Build Tool: Vite
**Decision**: Use Vite for frontend build and development
**Rationale**:
- Extremely fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- Minimal configuration required
- Native ES modules support
- Works excellently with vanilla JavaScript
- Strong TypeScript support if needed later

**Alternatives considered**:
- Webpack: Mature but complex configuration
- Parcel: Zero-config but less flexible
- Rollup: Good for libraries, overkill for apps

### Authentication Strategy: JWT + HTTP-Only Cookies
**Decision**: JWT tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies
**Rationale**:
- Secure against XSS attacks (HTTP-only)
- Automatic inclusion in requests
- Stateless authentication suitable for REST API
- Industry standard approach

**Alternatives considered**:
- Session-based: Requires server-side storage
- Local storage JWT: Vulnerable to XSS attacks
- OAuth integration: Unnecessary complexity for MVP

### Database Schema Design Patterns
**Decision**: Single table inheritance with JSON columns for flexible data
**Rationale**:
- PostgreSQL JSON support for variable property attributes
- Simple queries for most common operations
- Flexible schema for different property types
- Good performance with proper indexing

**Alternatives considered**:
- EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value): Too complex for queries
- Multiple tables per property type: Overly normalized
- Document database: Loses ACID guarantees

### Testing Strategy
**Decision**: TestContainers for integration tests, real PostgreSQL
**Rationale**:
- Real database behavior in tests
- Isolated test environments
- Easy CI/CD integration
- Matches production environment closely

**Alternatives considered**:
- In-memory database: Different behavior than PostgreSQL
- Mocked database: Doesn't test real SQL interactions
- Shared test database: Test isolation issues

### Frontend State Management: Vanilla JavaScript Modules
**Decision**: ES6 modules with simple state management pattern
**Rationale**:
- No framework complexity
- Easy to understand and maintain
- Sufficient for moderate complexity
- Fast loading and execution

**Alternatives considered**:
- React/Vue: Unnecessary complexity for requirements
- Redux/Vuex: Overkill for simple state needs
- Web Components: Limited browser support complexities

## API Design Patterns

### REST API Structure
**Decision**: RESTful endpoints with JSON responses
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard approach
- Clear resource-based URLs
- Stateless operations
- Easy to test and document

### Error Handling Strategy
**Decision**: Structured error responses with HTTP status codes
**Rationale**:
- Consistent error format across all endpoints
- Machine-readable error codes
- Human-readable error messages
- Proper HTTP semantics

### Validation Strategy
**Decision**: Backend validation with frontend pre-validation
**Rationale**:
- Security-first approach (never trust frontend)
- Good user experience with immediate feedback
- Single source of truth for business rules

## Performance Considerations

### Database Indexing Strategy
**Decision**: Composite indexes on frequently queried combinations
**Rationale**:
- Fast property searches by location and price
- Efficient user-based property filtering
- Quick metric calculations

### Caching Strategy (Future)
**Decision**: In-memory caching for calculated metrics
**Rationale**:
- Expensive financial calculations
- Infrequently changing property data
- Significant performance improvement potential

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
**Decision**: Server-side validation with sanitization
**Rationale**:
- Prevent SQL injection and XSS
- Data integrity enforcement
- Security-first architecture

### Rate Limiting
**Decision**: Per-IP rate limiting for API endpoints
**Rationale**:
- Prevent abuse and DoS attacks
- Protect database resources
- Fair usage policies

## Development Workflow

### Database Migrations
**Decision**: GORM auto-migration for development, versioned for production
**Rationale**:
- Fast development iteration
- Controlled production deployments
- Version-controlled schema changes

### Environment Configuration
**Decision**: Environment variables with defaults
**Rationale**:
- 12-factor app compliance
- Easy deployment across environments
- Secure secrets management

## Deployment Strategy

### Containerization
**Decision**: Docker containers for both frontend and backend
**Rationale**:
- Consistent deployment environments
- Easy scaling and orchestration
- Development-production parity

### Database Deployment
**Decision**: Managed PostgreSQL service (production)
**Rationale**:
- Professional backup and monitoring
- High availability options
- Reduced operational overhead
