## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Real estate investors need a centralized platform to evaluate rental property investments. They require comprehensive property tracking, automated financial calculations, and collaborative decision-making tools to make informed investment choices. The system serves both individual investors and investment teams who need to analyze multiple properties against their specific investment criteria.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Property Entry & Analysis**
   **Given** a user has property details, **When** they enter address, purchase price, and rental information, **Then** the system automatically calculates Cap Rate, Cash-on-Cash Return, NOI, and other investment metrics

2. **Investment Criteria Comparison** 
   **Given** a user has defined buying-box criteria, **When** they view a property, **Then** the system shows how the property compares against their investment criteria

3. **Team Collaboration**
   **Given** multiple users are evaluating properties, **When** a user adds comments to a property, **Then** other authorized users can view and respond to those comments

4. **Third-Party Valuation Integration**
   **Given** a user wants to analyze a property, **When** they manually enter third-party valuation data (Zillow, Redfin), **Then** the system stores and displays the average of those valuation information alongside calculated metrics

5. **Financial Calculations**
   **Given** a user has entered financing terms, **When** the system calculates metrics, **Then** mortgage payment, cash to close, and leveraged returns are accurately computed

6. **Portfolio Management**
   **Given** a user wants to compare properties, **When** they view their property portfolio, **Then** they can sort and filter by key metrics like Cap Rate, CoC Return, and RTV ratio

### Edge Cases
- **Incomplete Data**: Properties with missing information display **unknown** values and skip investment metric calculations until all required fields are provided
- **Dynamic Calculations**: When financing terms change (e.g., interest rates), metrics are recalculated automatically the next time the user views property details
- **Data Validation**: The system identifies mandatory fields required for computing investment metrics and prevents calculations with insufficient data

## Requirements
